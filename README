 Description
 -----------
 This simple programme takes user input or file input. Set the flag based
 on the flag sign that user input captured by geopt. then the actual value
 will be processed based on the flag and correspond form will be printed
 out. The form include base from 2 to 36. float point form, english form.
 Full error checking will be applied during each stage of the entire
 programme

How to compile
--------------
To compile this program, simply navigate to the directory containing the
 source files for PA3 (which should include the Makefile) and type 'make'.
 
How to run
 ----------
To run the program from stdin mode, type the executable name plus the flag
info ( -f for file, -h for help, -o for specify out put base -i for 
specify input base, -b for float point mode) plus argument as required
in -h.
Alternatively, type executable name+ file name to turn to
file readin mode
For example: 

./pa3

./pa3 -f input
 
Normal output
-------------
Normal output is printed to stdout.  An example of normal output would be
the following:    

Abno30xyz@ieng9]:pa3$ ./pa3 -e -o 10 -i 36 10 CSE30

10
three six 
36
		  
CSE30
two one four eight zero zero one two 
21480012
-------------
Abnormal output is printed to stderr.  If lack of arument:

30xhy@ieng9]:pa3:521$ ./pa3 -h
Usage: ./pa3 [-ebh] [-i input_base] [-o output_base(s)] -f input_file | numbers
        -e -- print number in english
	-b -- print floating point number (if floating point) in binary
	-h -- this help/usage message

Testing
------

This program was tested by 6 unit test script:

testprintEnglish.c
testprintFPBinary.c
testprintBase.c
testprocessIntToken.c
testprocessFPToken.c
testprintIntBinary.c

each test script is in charge of one certain files
Also output value of this programme has been double checked
with pa3test test programe.

	
Questions
---------


 1) What key combination can you use to terminate a running program?

	Ctrl-D / Ctrl-C

 2) What key combination can you use to suspend a running program?
   What's the difference between terminating and suspending a program?

   Ctrl-Z suspend a runnin gprogram
   Stop program is killing process which means the process will be 
   termianted instantly and can't recover it.
   suspend the programme is kinda like pause the program. you can
   resume it at the back by print bg on command line. this allows the
   suspended programme run  in the background

 3) What key combination can you use to stop transfer to current terminal? 
 How do you resume transfer to current terminal? 
 (This is useful when your terminal stops responding!)

 	Ctrl-s stop the transfer to the terminal

	Ctrl-q resume the transfer to the current terminal

 4) In a linux shell, how would you list all
 files in your current working directory (including hidden files)?
 typ say you just ran the following command 
 (don't worry too much about what it's doing):
 cs30xyz$ grep August BoringReports.txt
 | sed -e 's/August[ \t]*//' > August_BoringReports.txt			
Without retyping or using the arrow keys,
how could you quickly run the same command again with all
instances of "August" replaced with "September"? 

 ^August^September^:&


 5) Say you are editing a file in vim.
 You have a variable named foo in your code,
 but you don't like the name foo anymore and
 you want to replace all variables named foo with bar.
 How can you do this from Command Mode in vim?
 [Note: There may be multiple ways to do this.] 

:%s/foo/bar/g
This command means find all string foo in the file and 
replace it with string bar.
